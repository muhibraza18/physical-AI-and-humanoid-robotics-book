## Prompt

The user initiated the `/sp.plan` command with a detailed description for creating an implementation plan for the technical book.

## Response snapshot

The `plan.md` file has been successfully generated and written to `specs/001-physical-ai-book/plan.md`. This plan incorporates the project constitution, the now-finalized feature specification, and the detailed execution phases, timelines, and technical decisions provided by the user.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The planning phase has been successfully completed with the generation of `plan.md`, based on the finalized specification.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `plan.md` was created/updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user confirmation to proceed with task generation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully progressed through the workflow, first by clarifying the specification, and then by generating the plan based on the complete information.
